# p-code-machine
This repository is used for Compilers subject. Here is presented a p-code machine developed in C language. The code was based on a (Pascal code)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-code_machine]. A p-code-machine (portable code machine) is a virtual machine designed to execute p-code (the assembly language of a hypothetical CPU).

## Commands
These are the commands accepted by the p-code-machine, you can find more about (here)[http://blackmesatech.com/2011/12/pl0/pl0.xhtml].
- LIT 0 a : load constant a;
- OPR 0 a : execute operation a (13 operations: RETURN, 5 math functions, and 7 comparison functions);
- LOD l a : load variable a from level l;
- STO l a : store variable a at level l;
- CAL l a : call procedure a at level l;
- INT 0 a : increment t-register by a;
- JMP 0 a : jump to a;
- JPC 0 a : jump conditional to a (if '0' jump, else don't jump).

This table shows the meaning of all 13 OPR operations:

| code  | Symbol | Semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0  | Return  | Return from a subroutine.  |
| 1  | Negate  | Negate the value on the top of the stack (i.e. multiply by -1).  |
| 2  | Add  | x=pop();y=pop();push(y+x).  |
| 3  | Subtract  | x=pop();y=pop();push(y-x).  |
| 4  | Multiply  | x=pop();y=pop();push(y*x).  |
| 5  | Divide  | x=pop();y=pop();push(y/x).  |
| 6  | Odd?  | Test the value at the top of the stack to see if it's odd or not.  |
| 7  | == | x=pop();y=pop();push(y==x). |
| 8  | <> | x=pop();y=pop();push(y<>x). |
| 9  | < | x=pop();y=pop();push(y<x). |
| 10  | >= | x=pop();y=pop();push(y>=x). |
| 11  | > | x=pop();y=pop();push(y>x). |
| 12  | <= | x=pop();y=pop();push(y<=x). |

## Getting Started
Here is some instructions that helps you how to run this code in your machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You'll need to install gcc compiler before you get forward.

### Compiling
To compile the code with gcc in your terminal just execute:
```
$ gcc main.c -o machine
```

### Executing
You can execute the code setting a a file as program parameter, or by writing the p-code directally on your terminal.

#### Executing the program on terminal
```
$ ./machine
```

#### Executing the program with a file
```
$ ./machine exemplos/fibonacciRec5
```

### Running the tests
There is some p-codes in "examples" directory that you can use to test.

#### Calculating 2Â² + 3 x 2 + 1
